Intro
1.)Mern stack is a combination of nongodb,ecpress,react and node js.
2.)So ultimately, we will have 2 folders oe for back end and another for front end using react.
3.)We as so created a script in the package json file and gave it a key value (dev).   XXXXXXXX
4.)So what this basically does is that it runs what ever line of code we assign to it.
5.)On that note, if we go to the terminal and type npm run dev it will run that code

.env
6.)So basically we have a port number and sometimes we might want to put our code in git repo.
7.)And we wouldn't want that port number to be visible to everyone.so we installed the dotenv package.
8.)This package creates an environment variable that will remain hidden.
9.)So we create a .env file in the backend folder (coulde be name.env or what ever)
10.)So the idea is when pushing the project to Git, just add the .env to the gitignore file so every thing there remains private.


POSTMAN
11.) Postman enables us to confirm if our requests(get,post,delete) is working 
12.) Basically we select the type of request we are making and just paste our url there.
13.) And we can save them too.
